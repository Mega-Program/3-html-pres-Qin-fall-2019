In the heat of the summer, I lie down on the lawn.

The pleasant scent of fresh cut grass enters my nose.

A neighbor's dog woofs and yaps excitedly at a scurrying squirrel. 

I look up at the sky: a picturesque combination of the dazzling sun and wispy clouds painted on a blue canvas.

The intimidating glare of the sun is making me sweat, so I move under the shade of a giant oak tree. Its sturdy branches enable me to again lie down in peace… 

An ice cream van drives by. The “ice cream song” melody follows in its wake, attracting children and adults alike to buy an icy treat.

This moment makes me feel calm and peaceful. It allows me to take a break from the everyday routines and expectations of life.

The heat of the summer is getting to me now and the ice cream song had stimulated my appetite… I think I’m going to go inside and search the refrigerator for a popsicle.



In the heat of the summer, I take a relaxing jog on the seashore.

The fresh, salty smell of the ocean enters my nose as I run. 

A seagull squawks and screeches in the distance, flying away after a failed attempt at stealing a beachgoer's food.

The cool ocean breaze that brushes against me is a sharp contrast to the hot, summer weather.

The sky is a picturesque combination of the dazzling sun and wispy clouds painted on a blue canvas.

Each step makes an indent in the wet sand, marking the path of my run.

The ocean waves crashing against the shore makes a soothing rythm.

This moment makes me feel calm and peaceful. It allows me to take a break from the everyday routines and expectations of life.
